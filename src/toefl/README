project description: 2d local and global blobs. 
This code produced results for, among others, the paper

M. Wiesenberger, J. Madsen, and A. Kendl, "Radial convection of finite ion temperature, high amplitude plasma blobs"
Phys. Plasmas 21, 092301 (2014).


toeflR is the for single GPU/OpenMP and visualizes results directly on screeen
toefl_hpc is the single GPU/OpenMP version using serial netcdf
toefl_mpi is the MPI + GPU/OpenMP version using parallel netcdf

All of these codes read in json input files given on the command line, 
of which there is a default file in the input folder. 

The equations themselves are defined in the toeflR.cuh file as two functor-objects for the explicit and
implicit part of a time integration scheme. 
The numerical and physical parameters are structured in a Parameters object in the parameters.h file.
The equations currently implemented are those for local and global gyrofluid equations in 
gyro-Bhom normalization. 
On the other hand there is also the possibility to compute fluid equations in a gravitational 
field also with and without Boussinesq approximation.
